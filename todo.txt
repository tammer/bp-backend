if anchor exists then assessment should exist
if you are anchored, then you can't go below



requirements page should know when it has been udpated and only offer next button if that is the case.
should also have a revert changes button

what happens when name changes on server (id stays the same)

requiremenst page should be probably always syncing with server

guy creates new skill.  we disagree and delete it. what happens to his profile?
vulnerability:  someone POSTS new tech skills x 1e20.
seems to be a vulnerability for any POST

confirm modal for tech, but do generic confirm modal to use site wide.

any button that writes to server should not be active on client until all loading is done!

i dont think we use the /invite route

anchor created, invite sent, invite accepted, anchor cancelled before accepted??

I am a member but ross sends invite to my other email address that BP doesn't know.
