ordering on deployed version of skills page!




requirements page should know when it has been udpated and only offer next button if that is the case.
should also have a revert changes button

what happens when name changes on server (id stays the same)

requiremenst page should be probably always syncing with server

guy creates new skill.  we disagree and delete it. what happens to his profile?
vulnerability:  someone POSTS new tech skills x 1e20.
seems to be a vulnerability for any POST

confirm modal for tech, but do generic confirm modal to use site wide.
